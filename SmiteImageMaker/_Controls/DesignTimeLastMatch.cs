Agni, God of Fire, is the embodiment of both of these qualities, with a head for each.\\n\\nThough the source of his origin warrants debate - for there are many tales of his parentage ranging from two simple sticks rubbed together, to the cosmic energy that made all things at the beginning of time - Agni is a pivotal and important God with many duties to the Pantheon. He is the twin brother to Indra, God of the Heavens and Rains and chief among warriors. Conversely, Agni is chief among priests, acting as messenger between mortals and Gods. Every Hindu ritual and prayer is performed in front of a fire of some kind, so Agni carries the words and sacrifices, traveling between the Earth and the Heavens. He is welcome in every home and every hearth and much beloved by the Faithful.\\n\\nThrough his flames, Agni provides heat and light, but also cleanses impurities. Smoke from his pyres create the air and hold the Heavens aloft. The sun, a source of fire itself, brings life-giving energy to the world, and his lightning streaks the sky during storms.\\n\\nFor all his kindness and service, Agni has two faces. One is the face of kindness and purity, turned towards the people and Gods. His other face, grim and resolute, guides the God of Fire, to play his role in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction, to burn and blacken all the atrocities of the world to ash."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.37,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.0,""MagicalPower"":170,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":7.5,""Mana"":255,""ManaPerFive"":4.7,""ManaPerLevel"":45,""Name"":""Agni"",""OnFreeRotation"":""true"",""Pantheon"":""Hindu"",""PhysicalPower"":0,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""PhysicalProtection"":11,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.6,""Pros"":"" High Area Damage"",""Roles"":"" Mage"",""Speed"":350,""Title"":""God of Fire"",""Type"":"" Ranged, Magical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""12s"",""cost"":""60/70/80/90/100"",""description"":""Agni summons a cloud of noxious fumes at his ground target location, doing damage every second.

For their worship, tides remain calm, rivers contained, and rainfall for crops plentiful. It was not always like this, however. Long ago, Ao Kuang grew greedy and expected greater sacrifices. When they were not given, he sent floods, tidal waves, and devastating storms, striking so much fear into the people they dared not speak of this violence to the Jade Emperor. Ao Kuang enjoyed his total control.\\n\\nThen came Sun Wukong to his undersea palace seeking a weapon for his famous journey to the West. Despite the offer of other weapons, Sun Wukong took the Ruyi Jingu Bang, an immense pillar that aided in controlling the tides. It was believed none could even lift it, but Sun Wukong spun it with ease. As if this were not humiliating enough, Sun Wukong demanded other gifts of armor, shoes, and helm, all of which Ao Kuang was forced to supply.\\n\\nNext, the demigod boy Nezha, playing in a stream, inadvertently shook Ao Kuang’s palace. Annoyed, the Dragon-God set forth his favorite scout to kill the child, but Nezha defended himself and the scout was slain.

Viewers traveled leagues just to see her art. So wondrous and majestic were her tapestries, it was said the spinner must have been instructed by the patron Goddess of Weavers herself, Athena. To this comparison, Arachne proudly scoffed, claiming not even the Gods rivaled her talent at weaving.\\n\\nWhen Athena heard this, disguised as a crone, she visited Arachne and encouraged her to show proper respect to the Gods. Arachne dismissed the old woman and issued a challenge that no God, not even Athena, could weave better than she. Furious, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge.\\n\\nThey both set to the loom with fervor. Athena wove a glorious tapestry depicting her battle with Poseidon over the city of Athens. Her detail and imagery were exquisite. Yet Arachne’s weavings depicted Zeus in his many infidelities with mortals. So flawless, so lifelike was her artistry, not even Athena could refute the skill, nor could she contain her anger at such a sleight. Violently, she tore Arachne’s tapestry and pressed a finger to Arachne’s forehead. Twisting in anguish, Arachne fell to the ground as additional legs grew from her body, screaming as she transformed into the first spider.\\n\\nIt was an act of anger and pity, a lesson and a curse, for spiders are the greatest of weavers, and Arachne, in particular, was to weave for all time, but none could doubt the consequence for Arachne’s pride. Still, within her twisted heart, Arachne never forgave Athena, consumed by a dark hatred that can be sated only by the destruction of the Gods."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.46,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":210,""ManaPerFive"":4.8,""ManaPerLevel"":41,""Name"":""Arachne"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Greek"",""PhysicalPower"":38,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.2,""PhysicalProtection"":13,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":3.0,""Pros"":"" High Single Target Damage, Great Jungler"",""Roles"":"" Assassin"",""Speed"":375,""Title"":""the Weaver"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""15/14/13/12/11s"",""cost"":""60/65/70/75/80"",""description"":""Upon activation, Arachne's next Basic Attack within 5s does additional damage and infects the target with Venom, dealing damage over time and healing Arachne every 0.5s for 3s."",""menuitems"":[{""description"":""Ability:"",""value"":""Stim""},{""description"":""Affects:"",""value"":""Enemies""},{""description"":""Damage:"",""value"":""Physical""}],""rankitems"":[{""description"":""Initial Damage:"",""value"":""50/75/100/125/150 (+35% of your Physical Power)""},{""description"":""Damage per Tick:"",""value"":""10/20/30/40/50 (+10% of your Physical Power)""},{""description"":""Healing per Tick:"",""value"":""10/20/30/40/50 (+10% of your Physical Power)""}],""secondaryDescription"":""""}},""abilityDescription2"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""15s"",""cost"":""70"",""description"":""Arachne spindles her webbing, and her next 3 successful Basic Attacks are executed with increased Attack Speed for 6s.

For this, Zeus is disgusted by him.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his sister. Athena and Ares are both Gods of War. Where Ares represents violence, force, and slaughter, Athena is the embodiment of intelligence, strategy, and leadership. Ares is quick to act and leave a bloody trail. Athena is thoughtful and careful with lives.

Though Aphrodite is married to Ares’ brother, Hephaestus, Ares takes what he wants, and Aphrodite gives in willingly. Their union created offspring almost as terrible as Ares himself: Phobos and Deimos, Fear and Terror.\\n\\nAres is loved only by the Spartans, who revere the God for his masculinity, his merciless warrior spirit, and tenacity against all odds.

Fortunately, she found an island that did not touch the ocean floor, so it was neither land nor sea, and thus bore her children. Artemis was born first, then miraculously aided as midwife in the birthing of her brother.\\n\\nArtemis spent her childhood in the hills and forests, training with her bow and hunting beasts. As she grew older and more beautiful, she also grew proud and ruthless when slighted or dishonored, especially against those that claimed to be better hunters than she. Adonis boasted this very thing and Artemis sent a wild boar to skewer him. The twin demigods Otos and Ephialtes, who could not be killed except by each other, threatened to kidnap Artemis and force her to marry one of them, but were tricked when Artemis, appearing as a doe, dashed between them. As they thrust with their spears they impaled each other. Finally, Actaeon, after peeping at Artemis while she bathed, was transformed into a stag and devoured by his own hunting dogs. Such is the wrath of Artemis.\\n\\nHer name is invoked by hunters seeking prey and by midwives during childbirth. Sacrifices are made in her name before a new military campaign.

So revered is she that Athens, greatest city in all the world, is named for her, and regal temples adorn the countryside in her honor, each tended by loyal priestesses. To Athena, a life is a precious thing that need not be wasted in frivolous battle. Bloodthirsty Ares, on the other hand, is reviled by their father and chained by his ravenous subjects.\\n\\nAt the Siege of Troy, Ares disobeyed Zeus and joined with the battle, fighting for the mortal Trojans. Athena rose to stop him, indirectly championing the Greeks, but directly keeping the order of divine law. Their fierce battle clashed in unspeakable proportions, ending only when Ares limped from the battle field, cowed by his sister and rival. With Ares diminished, the tide of the war shifted and the heroes of the Greek Army toppled Troy.\\n\\nIn times of war, prayers are sent to both Gods. Ares, for bloodstained victory, Athena for honor, valor, and the wisdom to fight with dignity. Make no mistake, these are times of war, and Ares has already answered the call to arms. Athena, ever cautious with lives, goes to battle without eagerness, but solemn necessity, for the Goddess of Wisdom knows honor is for the living.

None adhere more vigorously to this creed than Bacchus, the Roman God of Wine, lewd behavior, and madness.\\n\\nAfter spending much of his formative years with his impressively intoxicated mentor Solinus, whom Bacchus loves like a father, the God of Wine is now a wanderer and teacher. He’s journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the “Mysteries of the Vine,” a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\\n\\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the “gift.” Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\\n\\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.4,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":185,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":7.5,""Mana"":200,""ManaPerFive"":4.8,""ManaPerLevel"":40,""Name"":""Bacchus"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Roman"",""PhysicalPower"":0,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""PhysicalProtection"":19,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":3.0,""Pros"":"" High Crowd Control, High Defense"",""Roles"":"" Guardian"",""Speed"":365,""Title"":""God of Wine"",""Type"":"" Melee, Magical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""10s"",""cost"":""40/65/90/115/140"",""description"":""Bacchus takes a drink from his jug, giving him additional Buffs."",""menuitems"":[{""description"":""Ability:"",""value"":""Buff""},{""description"":""Affects:"",""value"":""Self""}],""rankitems"":[{""description"":""Drunk-O-Meter:"",""value"":""33/35/37/39/41%""},{""description"":""Protections:"",""value"":""15/20/25/30/35""},{""description"":""Duration:"",""value"":""6s""}],""secondaryDescription"":""""}},""abilityDescription2"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""16s"",""cost"":""70/75/80/85/90"",""description"":""Bacchus jumps into the air and, not so gracefully, comes slamming to the ground belly first, knocking all enemies into the air and dealing damage.

Disguised as brahmins, they sought alms from the villagers in order to sustain themselves. They soon learned that a demon, Bakasura, was living outside the village, devouring the people as they passed through the woods. The chief went to the demon and begged that the feasting stop. In return, a cart of food would be sent to Bakasura each day. Bakasura consumed not only the provisions, but the person that brought the cart as well.\\n\\nAfter hearing this tale from a weeping woman whose son would bear the cart on the morrow, Kunti declared that her son Bhima, who possessed impossible strength and had slain demons before, would take the cart instead, as repayment to the kindness the villagers had shown their family.\\n\\nOnce in the forest, Bhima nonchalantly ate the food intended for Bakasura. Furious, Bakasura threatened to eat Bhima, which he just laughed off, goading the demon to attack him. All day they battled until Bhima finally slew the demon, tied him to the cart and dragged the body back to the village, where the people celebrated the victory in bewilderment.\\n\\nHunger, however, is a demon that cannot be defeated and, inevitably, Bakasura’s disgusting rumble will rise again, now more ravenous than ever and ready to feed."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.46,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":200,""ManaPerFive"":4.8,""ManaPerLevel"":39,""Name"":""Bakasura"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Hindu"",""PhysicalPower"":38,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.2,""PhysicalProtection"":13,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.8,""Pros"":"" High Single Target Damage"",""Roles"":"" Assassin"",""Speed"":370,""Title"":""the Great Devourer"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""12s"",""cost"":""60/65/70/75/80"",""description"":""Bakasura leaps to his ground target location, doing damage to all enemies in the area and reducing their Physical Protection."",""menuitems"":[{""description"":""Ability:"",""value"":""Leap""},{""description"":""Affects:"",""value"":""Enemy""},{""description"":""Damage:"",""value"":""Physical""},{""description"":""Radius:"",""value"":""15""}],""rankitems"":[{""description"":""Damage:"",""value"":""100/160/220/280/340 (+60% of your Physical Power)""},{""description"":""Physical Protection Debuff:"",""value"":""20""},{""description"":""Duration:"",""value"":""3s""}],""secondaryDescription"":""""}},""abilityDescription2"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""15s"",""cost"":""55"",""description"":""Bakasura grabs a minion and devours it, healing himself and gaining a Protections Buff.

Mercilessly, they cull the populations of invasive vermin and stinging scorpions, protecting the home from vile invaders. Perhaps, the most troublesome enemy of the cat is the serpent, and there was no greater snake in the world than the horrendous Apep.\\n\\nCircling the world along the horizon line, Apep’s scaly girth waited in ambush each morning for Ra to rise and bring light to the world. To fend off this beast, Ra kept the company of his daughter, Bastet. Since time began, as Ra lifted into the Eastern sky, Bastet would spit and howl, claws bared against the treacherous Apep. Countless battles were fought, countless mornings faced uncertainty, until, at last, Bastet tore the foul serpent apart.\\n\\nWith her greatest enemy gone, Bastet is free to prowl as she pleases. Now, she is the guardian of home and hearth,  idol to women - especially those desiring children and exploring their sensuality - and patron of arts, wine, and any occasion of revelry.

She drew the affection of the hero archer, Hou Yi, and the two were soon married. Everything was perfect.\\n\\nYet, beneath the Heavens, all was not well. Ten suns, the ten children of the Jade Emperor, rose to scorch the earth and boil the seas. Brave Hou Yi, bow in hand, shot nine from the sky, sparing only one. Though the world was saved, the Jade Emperor was furious his children were killed. In punishment, Hou Yi and Chang’e were made mortal.\\n\\nChang’e grew melancholy and danced no more. To restore their status in the Heavens, Hou Yi found the Elixir of Immortality, but thieves came to steal it while he was hunting. Chang’e struggled to hide the Elixir, but, in the end, was forced to drink it. Too much for one person, the Elixir gave her immortality, but it also swept her into the sky.\\n\\nSince then, Chang’e has lived on the moon, forbidden to see her husband, a Jade Rabbit her only companion. Yet, the Earth is once again in peril, and Chang’e finds herself upon the mortal surface. Perhaps, this is a second chance.

So many legends are there of his achievements they could be spoken for days and yet still more be told. And yet throughout his triumphs, his death loomed constant, foretold and certain.\\n\\nIn his early years, while still bearing the name Sétanta, he was already an impressive individual, catching the attention of King Conchobar with feats of strength and agility. Conchobar invited the boy to a feast hosted by the smith, Culann. Left unchained by mistake, Culann’s fearsome guard dog assailed Sétanta when he arrived. With only his bare hands, the boy defended himself and slew the beast. Ashamed, Sétanta swore to Culann he would personally train a new dog and would guard his home in the interim. Impressed, the druid Cathbad declared Sétanta would now be called the Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann.\\n\\nThis was the birth of a hero, but his death was yet bound in prophecy. Cathbad, the same druid that named him, promised a group of boys, “Any that take up arms this day will become legends.” Seeking greatness, Cú Chulainn raced off to find weapons before hearing more. He saw years of victory, of achieving the impossible, of becoming a legend before him.

He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid’s steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.\\n\\nPsyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid’s invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\\n\\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid’s arrows and fell in love with him.\\n\\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together.

Cowardly and quick the dragon slithered into the rapid river waters, but Erlang Shen captured it with a great chain and bound it beneath a shrine. Thus the floods subsided.\\n\\nWhen Sun Wukong’s troublesome antics drew the ire of the Jade Emperor, Erlang Shen faced the Monkey King on the battlefield. For every form Sun Wukong took, Erlang Shen transformed as well. Across sea and sky and land they battled. Thus was Sun Wukong sent fleeing for his life.\\n\\nWhen the people were plagued by demons and monsters, Erlang Shen slaughtered them to keep his countrymen safe. Three-bladed spear in hand and hunting dog at his side, no evil could threaten the innocent or the Empire. Thus, Erlang came to be loved and worshipped.\\n\\nA Goddess mother and a mere mortal father, he is of two worlds. He is both sage and a soldier, humble yet regal, his veins filled with the blood of men and the divine blood of his uncle, the Jade Emperor. Having risen above his forbidden origins, Erlang Shen has proven himself among the greatest of heroes in the Jade Empire. Perhaps that is why he now takes the field.

It is unknown how, but Fenrir is Unbound.\\n\\nThrice they tried to bind him, each time convincing Fenrir that the chains were nothing more than a challenge for his strength, a test to see if he could shatter them. The first two God-forged fetters were easily broken beneath the beast’s terrible power, but the third was a ribbon, dwarf made, and Fenrir grew suspicious of the God’s intentions. As a show of faith, he demanded one of them place a hand in his mouth, and if the ribbon proved magical in nature, he would exact punishment. Brave, if foolish, Tyr put his fist in Fenrir’s maw as the ribbon was secured to the wolf’s leg. Fenrir strained and screamed, but could not break free, and in rage, he devoured Tyr’s hand.\\n\\nFor a time, Fenrir was forgotten, the dire prophecy just a memory.

She’s the object of desire for every God, every man, and the envy of every woman. Even the Frost Giants crave her for their own, often devising devious plans to trick or force her into marriage. But Freya is proud and strong, with the cunning to escape her enemies and ruthlessly retaliate. Every rose bears thorns, but this one wields swords.\\n\\nWere it up to her, Freya would have little to do with blood and blades. Her name literally means “the lady,” and none of more worthy of the title. She adores bright flowers, pleasant company, and the sweet lilt of a sad love song. She’s sensual and amorous, invoked by worshipers seeking to bear a child or find a lover. Ruler of the realm of Sessrumnir, a place much like Valhalla, where the souls of dead warriors spend eternity, Freya provides comfort and bliss to the fallen.\\n\\nOnce, Freya was married to the mysterious and elusive God, Od. Immediately following their wedding, Od went on a journey to distant and inhospitable lands. So long was he gone the Gods presumed him dead. Distraught and heartbroken, Freya spilled tears of gold and searched the globe for him. Finally, she discovered him ship-wrecked and twisted into a hideous sea monster. Melancholy but loyal, she stayed and comforted him. Though one night, while she slept, a daring hunter slew the beast Od had become. Moved by Freya’s utter despair, the Gods agreed to allow Od into Sussrumnir, despite the fact he had not died in battle, so he and Freya could remain together forever."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.39,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":175,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":7.5,""Mana"":220,""ManaPerFive"":4.5,""ManaPerLevel"":37,""Name"":""Freya"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Norse"",""PhysicalPower"":0,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""PhysicalProtection"":14,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.8,""Pros"":"" High Area Damage, Medium Crowd Control"",""Roles"":"" Mage"",""Speed"":375,""Title"":""Queen of the Valkyries"",""Type"":"" Melee, Magical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""11s"",""cost"":""60/65/70/75/80"",""description"":""Freya activates a Buff that makes her Basic Attacks do additional Magical damage."",""menuitems"":[{""description"":""Ability:"",""value"":""Buff""},{""description"":""Affects:"",""value"":""Self""},{""description"":""Damage:"",""value"":""Magical""}],""rankitems"":[{""description"":""Damage per Attack:"",""value"":""40/55/70/85/100 (+25% of your Magical Power)""},{""description"":""Duration:"",""value"":""5s""}],""secondaryDescription"":""""}},""abilityDescription2"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""11s"",""cost"":""60/65/70/75/80"",""description"":""Freya activates a Buff that makes her Basic Attacks ranged, dealing additional Magical damage and Slowing the target and all nearby enemies.

Shiva, the supreme being, returned and found this child doggedly blocking his path. Fearing the safety of his wife, Shiva drew his sword and cut him down.\\n\\n“This is your son!” Parvati cried. “You must save him!”\\n\\nHurriedly, Shiva replaced the head of the child with the wisest creature in the world, that of an elephant. Thus, was Ganesha truly born.\\n\\nGenerous, warm-hearted, and optimistic, Ganesha has assumed authority over the very thing his mother tasked of him - obstacles. For those whose hearts are filled with boastful arrogance, Ganesha challenges progress. Financial difficulties, faulty materials, and unhappiness plague their every action. But, for the honest, the hard working, Ganesha clears the way. A life of good fortune, bright skies, and joyous laughter. \\n\\nObstacles can be either placed or removed. So, to Ganesha all mortals pray when starting a new endeavor, that their path will be open and their future bright. That he may grant them success.\\n\\nOnly with reluctance has Ganesha joined the Battle of the Gods. Violence is the last obstacle the elephant-God would ever place.

As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\\n\\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\\n\\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei’s fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao’s gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao’s retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\\n\\nAfter his death, Guan Yu’s spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshippers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\\n\\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted. If their cause is just, he leads armies to victory. Among the Gods of any Pantheon, there are few as deadly and none as righteous as Guan Yu."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.45,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":220,""ManaPerFive"":4.8,""ManaPerLevel"":32,""Name"":""Guan Yu"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Chinese"",""PhysicalPower"":37,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.0,""PhysicalProtection"":16,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":3.0,""Pros"":"" High Sustain, High Mobility"",""Roles"":"" Warrior"",""Speed"":375,""Title"":""Saint of War"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""12s"",""cost"":""60/65/70/75/80"",""description"":""Guan Yu's courageous leadership is infectious and, when focused, heals himself and his allies.

Zeus, the youngest brother, escaped this fate and freed them once he’d grown strong enough to battle Cronus. Together, the six siblings defeated the Titans and banished them to the dark realm of Tartarus. Now the reigning Gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades drew lots for dominion. Hades drew the Underworld.\\n\\nOf the few that have entered the Underworld and come back, all speak dismally of the place, never wishing to return. Yet Hades, himself, rarely leaves the subterranean realm, constantly seeking ways to grow the numbers of the dead.\\n\\nWhen he desired a wife, Hades captured the radiant Persephone, daughter of the Goddess Demeter. Concealed in the Underworld, none could reach her, so Demeter cursed the land with a great famine. The other Gods pleaded with her to end it lest she destroy mankind, but she would not relent until her daughter was returned. Hades finally let Persephone leave, though not before feeding her pomegranate seeds. Having consumed the fruit, she was bound forever to Hades and required to return to her husband once per year to eat of the seeds again. This, it is said, is a time of mourning and the cause of winter.\\n\\nWhile many fear death and view it as evil, in truth, Hades endeavors only to keep balance. He is stern but fair.

Now, the forces of the great river are at his command!\\n\\nThroughout history, no river has been the source of more nourishment or more destruction than China’s Yellow River. Its basin valley was the cradle that birthed Chinese civilization, feeding fields with water and millions of tons of collected sediments, which give the river its yellow hue. The river is also treacherous and prone to flooding, destroying shoreline settlements and drowning thousands.\\n\\nLong ago, Feng Yi, a mortal man living along the riverside, watched in dismay as a storm stirred the waters and gorged the banks. It would not be long before the mighty river consumed his village. Both humble and wise, Feng Yi tied rocks to his belt before casting himself into the waters. This act of sacrifice did more than appease the angry river, it promoted Feng Yi to Godhood over it. Thus, he became He Bo.\\n\\nMuch time passed, and He Bo grew proud of his great river, so proud that he declared the Yellow River the biggest body of water anywhere. A passerby asked if He Bo had seen the North Sea, but He Bo dismissed the comment, for heavy rains were falling and the river was roaring and full. As time wore on, thought of the North Sea tickled his mind, so he made the journey. There, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea warmly met him.  Viewing the endless expanse of water, He Bo was humbled and returned to his River wiser.\\n\\nFor He Bo, there are no greater virtues than wisdom and humility.

Odin, the All-Father, uncovered prophecies that Hel and her siblings would be the source of great calamity resulting in Ragnarök, the battle that would end all things. In an effort to prevent this, he cast each of the three into different realms; not quite a prison, though far from freedom. For Hel, Odin gave her charge of the realm of the dead, specifically those that died of sickness and old age. For himself, Odin retained Valhalla for those that died in battle.\\n\\nAt birth, Hel’s face was cast half in shadow, half in light; she was both living and dead, so took immediately and graciously to her new role, gifting Odin with the ravens Huginn and Muninn in appreciation. As the spirits of the kind-hearted, the sick, the elderly were brought to her, she cared for them, gave them comfort, yet those she deemed evil she mercilessly hurled into the frozen depths of Niflheim.\\n\\nYet, despite Odin’s efforts, destiny cannot be averted.

An oracle of Jupiter advised he should pledge his service to the king Eurystheus, and so Hercules reluctantly did so. Jealous of the demigod, the king set him to twelve impossible tasks, expecting him to fail at the first, to slay the Nemean Lion and return with its hide.\\n\\nThe Nemean Lion captured women and devoured soldiers. Its fur was so thick no weapon could pierce it, and its claws so sharp, no armor could guard against them. Hercules tracked the lion to its mountain caves and drew it out, firing arrows that shattered against the beast’s impenetrable coat. Agilely, he dodged as the lion leapt to maul him. In the end, Hercules aimed a powerful shot straight into the lion’s roaring maw, a place the powerful fur did not protect, and slew it. Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\\n\\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero’s return. Immediately the legend of Hercules began to grow. Eleven more labours the confounded king set against him, but time after time, year after year, Hercules performed what could not be done, earning fame, glory, and the peace he so desperately sought."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.4,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":205,""ManaPerFive"":4.3,""ManaPerLevel"":32,""Name"":""Hercules"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Roman"",""PhysicalPower"":39,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.0,""PhysicalProtection"":18,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":3.0,""Pros"":"" High Single Target Damage, High Sustain"",""Roles"":"" Warrior"",""Speed"":375,""Title"":""Champion of Rome"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""14s"",""cost"":""60/65/70/75/80"",""description"":""Hercules delivers a mighty strike, driving all enemies back, damaging and Stunning them.

Summoned to the underworld, their father, Hun Hunapu never returned. Instead his new offspring, half-brothers to Hun Batz and Hun Chauen, appeared. The Hero Twins were everything the original twins were not, strong, athletic, and clever. And they were extremely gifted at playing Pitz.\\n\\nA jealous rivalry formed between the two sets of twins.

Frustrated with these antics, the Hero Twins kicked the ball into a tree, knowing Hun Batz and his brother considered themselves excellent climbers and would go after it. Yet, the higher they climbed, the taller the tree grew, until they could not get back down. Pleased with their magic thus far, The Hero Twins encouraged Hun Batz and Hun Chouen to use their belts like tails in order to escape the terrible height. However, upon doing so, they were mysteriously and humiliatingly transformed into monkeys.\\n\\nThough the Monkey Twins, as they are now called, came to be worshipped as Gods of Art and Music, the animosity they hold for the Hero Twins remains.

She could not, for she had already eaten the fruit that grew in Yomi. Izanagi insisted. He would not leave her in this place.

Meanwhile, remain in darkness, she cautioned him, for the realm of the dead was not meant for the living to see. Taken by foreboding, Izanagi lit a torch and laid eyes upon his wife. No longer the graceful, elegant beauty she once was, Izanami now appeared a rotting corpse, hollow and decayed, maggot ridden and foul. Frightened and disgusted, Izanagi broke his vow and fled.\\n\\nThrough the bowels of Yomi he ran, pursued by the fiend that was once his wife. Escaping the cave entrance, Izanagi rolled a boulder in place to block it. Sealed within, betrayed and cursed, consumed with wrathful anger, Izanami swore, one thousand lives would she take each day. One thousand to pay for the broken promise he made.\\n\\nSince then, Izanami has kept her vow, each day reaching beyond the grave to pull souls to Yomi.

It’s a word used to describe those that break the rules, that take what they want, and care nothing for those hurt along the way. Loki, the trickster God, would say villainy is nothing more than a point of view.\\n\\nThe point of view of fools too mindless to seize opportunity.\\n\\nOf course, with Loki now on the loose, the implications are dire. The end of times may be at hand. The final battle, Ragnarok, possibly on the horizon, for it was foretold that Loki would break free of his prison and herald the horrific final battle that would leave the Gods slain, the heavens sundered, and the world in ashes. None are more eager for that time of chaos than Loki.\\n\\nBefore his confinement, Loki’s malicious mischief managed to affect every God in ways both beneficial and terrible. Yet Loki’s most heinous act was in the death of the God of light, Baldr.\\n\\nBaldr’s prophetic dreams showcased his own death. Fearful for her son, Frigg forced all objects of the world to swear never to harm him. All save mistletoe. Cruelly amused, Loki forged a spear from the plant and provided it to Baldr’s brother Hodr. The Gods had a new favorite game, hurling objects at Baldr and laughing as they harmlessly ricocheted. So Hodr threw the spear, but, to everyone’s horror Baldr was impaled. Hel agreed to release Baldr from the underworld if all creatures of the world mourned the God of Light.  And all did, save one crone who refused. So Baldr died.\\n\\nWhen it was discovered the crone was Loki in disguise, the furious Gods bound him in entrails and hung a venomous serpent overhead. Loki’s wife, Sigyn, collected the dripping venom in a bowl, but when she was forced to empty it, Loki was struck, causing such anguish his thrashing would shake the world.\\n\\nBut now Loki is free and already wreaking havoc. If the prophetic Volva are correct, and they always are, then the end of all things has finally come."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.35,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":210,""ManaPerFive"":4.2,""ManaPerLevel"":35,""Name"":""Loki"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Norse"",""PhysicalPower"":38,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.4,""PhysicalProtection"":11,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.9,""Pros"":"" High Single Target Damage"",""Roles"":"" Assassin"",""Speed"":375,""Title"":""The Trickster God"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""15s"",""cost"":""70/75/80/85/90"",""description"":""Loki disappears in a puff of smoke.

No stranger to combat, he once slew the monster Argus, the demon with one hundred watchful eyes, using speed and guile alone. But this war is different. The foes are stronger, the stakes higher, and Mercury a pivotal cog in the machine. Should he fail to deliver even a single order the balance could tip, and the time left for this world would be truly mercurial."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.35,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":200,""ManaPerFive"":4.4,""ManaPerLevel"":40,""Name"":""Mercury"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Roman"",""PhysicalPower"":38,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.13,""PhysicalProtection"":12,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.9,""Pros"":"" High Single Target Damage, High Mobility"",""Roles"":"" Assassin"",""Speed"":381,""Title"":""Messenger of the Gods"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""8s"",""cost"":""50"",""description"":""Mercury moves in the blink of an eye, dealing one melee attack to every enemy within the target area.

What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\\n\\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father’s belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshippers.\\n\\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus’ daughter. A competition was held – each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\\n\\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.4,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.0,""MagicalPower"":175,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":7.5,""Mana"":245,""ManaPerFive"":4.6,""ManaPerLevel"":40,""Name"":""Poseidon"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Greek"",""PhysicalPower"":0,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""PhysicalProtection"":8,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.2,""Pros"":"" High Area Damage"",""Roles"":"" Mage"",""Speed"":360,""Title"":""God of the Oceans"",""Type"":"" Ranged, Magical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""10s"",""cost"":""60/70/80/90/100"",""description"":""Poseidon summons forth a wave that travels in a line, dealing damage and pushing back all enemies in its path."",""menuitems"":[{""description"":""Ability:"",""value"":""Line""},{""description"":""Affects:"",""value"":""Enemy""},{""description"":""Damage:"",""value"":""Magical""}],""rankitems"":[{""description"":""Damage:"",""value"":""100/140/180/220/260 (+70% of your Magical Power)""},{""description"":""Tidal Meter:"",""value"":""-30% Tide""}],""secondaryDescription"":""""}},""abilityDescription2"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""20/18/16/14/12s"",""cost"":""65/70/75/80/85"",""description"":""Poseidon activates his Trident, granting movement speed and making his Basic Attacks fire 2 additional shots in a spread for 6s.

Their father, Izanagi, would have none of it and decreed that Susano live in the Underworld. His mood dark at this news, Susano committed heinous acts of vandalism and murder. Acts that sent Amaterasu into shameful hiding.\\n\\nCast low, Susano descended to earth on his way to the Underworld. He carried only his Ten-Span Sword, and regret for his actions. What had his defilements achieved but to envelop the world in darkness? This was his nature, to broil like a storm, to frighten and destroy what stood in his path.\\n\\nBut a storm could also herald life.\\n\\nAt a river side, Susano ventured upon an elderly couple, weeping and cradling their young daughter. Eight children, they’d had once, but now only one remained; seven devoured by the eight-headed serpent. Susano was resolved. To atone for his crimes, to prove his father wrong, to better himself, Susano would slay this beast.\\n\\nEight traps he laid, one for each head of the creature, with eight tubs of aromatic saké as bait. Slithering forward, the Orochi spread its gruesome heads to drink from the trapped tubs. Susano cut the rope. Gates dropped. The heads were imprisoned. One by one, he chopped the eight necks, until only the wriggling tail remained. Sweeping his blade split the reptilian hide, leaving notches in his blade but revealing a brilliant sword inside: the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.\\n\\nTo his sister, he gave the blade. An act of atonement, but not an apology. His true nature would never change, but his intention could.\\n\\nThough seen on the battlefield of the Gods, Susano’s fight is not truly against those foes, but within himself.

Yet his hammer, Mjolnir is nearly as famous as he is, and Thor will not be parted from it.\\n\\nOdin, the All-Father, bore many children, but none as well known nor as mighty as Thor, who had the strength to move mountains and the power to call lightning from the sky. Despite these incredible gifts, Thor’s enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor’s near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\\n\\nSif, Thor’s wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\\n\\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki’s fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\\n\\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants. Proud and mighty, Thor beat back the evil horde and continues to defend Asgard to this day. With Mjolnir in hand, Thor is an unstoppable force that even other Gods would do well to avoid."",""MP5PerLevel"":0.29,""MagicProtection"":30,""MagicProtectionPerLevel"":0.9,""MagicalPower"":0,""MagicalPowerPerLevel"":0.0,""Mana"":240,""ManaPerFive"":4.4,""ManaPerLevel"":38,""Name"":""Thor"",""OnFreeRotation"":"""",""Pantheon"":""Norse"",""PhysicalPower"":39,""PhysicalPowerPerLevel"":2.4,""PhysicalProtection"":14,""PhysicalProtectionPerLevel"":2.9,""Pros"":"" High Single Target Damage, Medium Crowd Control"",""Roles"":"" Assassin"",""Speed"":370,""Title"":""God of Thunder"",""Type"":"" Melee, Physical"",""abilityDescription1"":{""itemDescription"":{""cooldown"":""12s"",""cost"":""70/75/80/85/90 "",""description"":""Thor throws Mjolnir forward, doing damage to all enemies in its path.

On the third attempt, Fenrir sensed a trick and demanded one of the Gods place their hand into his mouth. If the binding proved magical, Fenrir would take the hand. Tyr agreed.\\n\\nJustice is not adherence to the law, but a code of fairness and morality.\\n\\nBound by the mystical ribbon, Fenrir devoured Tyr’s hand. It was the price to be paid. And Tyr paid it willingly. Even Fenrir deserved justice.\\n\\nOne handed, Tyr is worshipped as a pinnacle of righteousness, called upon for valor in battle, balance in law, and the fortitude to face the impossible. As the cloud of war blackens the world, and fear grips the people, Tyr is stooped by the weight of expectation. With blade in hand, he takes the field. For he is Courage. He is Honor.

After conquering the Underworld and all the Earth, Bali managed to wrest the Heavens from the God Indra. Unable to reclaim his seat, Indra implored Vishnu for aid, and so Vishnu took the form of a small mortal man, a priest named Vamana.\\n\\nIn his splendid palace, Bali was giving gifts to the pious. Vishnu, disguised as the monk Vamana and carrying a wooden umbrella, requested only as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali offered Vamana an island but Vamana stuck to his request, which Bali granted against the wishes of his advisor. Immediately, Vamana grew to cosmic proportions, crashing through the ceiling of the palace and filling the sky. With one colossal step, he engulfed all the Earth and the Underworld. With a second step, he consumed the heavens. Now, with everything under his two units, Vamana had nowhere to place his third step. He challenged Bali to go back on his word or offer somewhere else for him to step. Bali’s demon army surged forth, but the demon king held them back. Bowing in humility, Bali offered his head as the third step. Vamana sends Bali to the underworld but, in recognizing Bali’s benevolence, shows mercy by granting him sovereignty over it in appreciation of Bali’s sacrifice.\\n\\nVishnu returned control of the Heavens to Indra and left his Avatar behind, but he also left behind a valuable lesson.

As Vulcan grew, he ventured to the surface and discovered fire and the art of smithing. His natural talents emerged and he forged wondrous jewels for his adopted mother.\\n\\nSummoned to a gala on Mount Olympus, Thetis wore Vulcan’s glittering gifts, but when Juno discovered Vulcan had made them, she jealously demanded he return to Mount Olympus. Angrily, Vulcan refused. In his stead, he sent a magnificent throne of gold and gems that imprisoned Juno when she sat upon it.\\n\\nFor three days Juno was so entombed, and would have remained so had not Jupiter, Vulcan’s father, interjected. To Vulcan he offered an exchange, Juno’s freedom for the hand of Venus, the most beautiful Goddess of Love. Vulcan agreed.\\n\\nThough his vengeance was served cold, the fire of spite still burns in Vulcan’s chest. Unable to truly forgive, he loses himself at the forge.

When Zeus was born, Rhea, Zeus’ mother, hid the child from Cronus and gave the Titan a rock in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed instead. In secret, Zeus grew up on the isle of Crete until he was old and strong enough to challenge his father. During their battle, Zeus slit open Cronus’ stomach, allowing his swallowed brothers and sisters to escape, slaying the Titan. Then, Zeus released the Cyclops and other beings Cronus had kept imprisoned. In gratitude, the Cyclops awarded Zeus control over lightning.\\n\\nWith his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, the three Gods drew lots to decide command of creation. Poseidon became king of the sea, Hades the underworld, and Zeus the sky. From his golden throne atop Mount Olympus, Zeus now rules Gods and Men with his wife Hera, upholding justice, hospitality, oaths, and honesty to all under his domain.\\n\\nYet, Zeus is a restless God, and while he holds high expectations for others, he does not keep those standards for himself. Chiefly, Zeus is nearly infamous for several infidelities to his wife which have resulted in dozens of children beget by other women, most famous of which are Hercules, Artemis, and Athena. Such wanton unfaithfulness is the source of great jealousy from Hera, though as King, Zeus can ultimately do as he wishes.\\n\\nWeather is dictated by the Thunder God’s mood.
